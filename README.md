# GarageProvider
Homie V3 based Garage Door Operator and Environment Multi-Sensor.

![Mini32 ESP32-WROVER-B](https://github.com/LilyGO/TTGO-T7-Demo/blob/master/images/T7V1.4.jpg)

### Features
* Transmits temperature, humidity, motion, door position, every 15 minutes.
* Transmits Motion ON status ONCE for 60 seconds since last motion trigger.
* Detects and transmits counter when saftey beam has been broken while door is operating.
* Determines and transmits door direction, current position, and final position after door toggle.
* Displays metrics every 1/2 seconds while Motion indicates Human presence.

### Operation sequence

    Device     Time shift          HomieEvent Stats  
    Sensor --> CharBuffer/Var ---> sendSensors()

### Basic Sequences

* OnMotionInterrupt:
* * Set Var and (reset)MotionDuration  for 10 minutes
* * Report once per/until MotionDuration interval
* Oled Display:
* * Display Sensor BUffers
* * Every 1/2 second until MotionDuration expires
* Temp/Humidity:
* * Save sample to Vars 
* * Every 10 Minutes
* ADCSafetyBeam:
* * Detect beam brake when voltage moves from 20.vdc to 2.15v 
* * Increment and send counter
* * Until RangingDuration expires
* MQTT-ONCmd: ON/on/true
* * Set RangingDuration
* * Toggle RELAY High for 750ms
* OnRangingInterrupt:
* * DataReady, compute direction and position as ranging vars
* * Read, save, and send ranging vars
* * Until RangingDuration expires
* * Shutdown Ranging until next door command
* Homie Statistics
* * Send all sensor value and Homie stats every config.json:device_stats_interval or 5 minutes


### Build
* PlatformIO Based Project
* Designed for use with ESP32, D1-Mini style hardware; 
* * Like: [LILYGOÂ® TTGO T7 V1.4 Mini32 ESP32-WROVER-B](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50033&Id=1258&FId=t3:50033:3)

### Programming Notes
* An attempt was made to use all ESP32 RTOS Features without success.  The Ardunio libraries do not work well together on multiple cores; YET!
